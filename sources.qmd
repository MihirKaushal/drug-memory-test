The data is from [Memory Test on Drugged Islanders Data in Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/steveahn/memory-test-on-drugged-islanders-data). The data originally had 9 columns, so I had to select only the information that I wanted to analyze.

The experiment was executed under the supervision of Mr. Almohalwas at UCLA. All aspects of the experiment such as experimental design, data collection and preprocessing was done by Steve Ahn.
