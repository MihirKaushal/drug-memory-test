In the experiment, there were three types of drugs as the treatment: Alprazolam, Triazolam, and Sugar Tablet as a placebo for the control group. The participants were both genders above 25 years old to ensure a fully developed pre-frontal cortex, a region responsible for higher level cognition and memory recall.

While triazolam and sugar are close to 0, Alprazolam, especially when the dose is 3, has a huge treatment effect on the difference in memory test score. This means that Alprazolam does have a negative impact on memory recall.
