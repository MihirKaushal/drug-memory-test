This website is made by Mihir Kaushal on August 3rd, 2024. 

I created this website as part of Kane's Data Science Bootcamp. I made the website using the R language. I utilized the help of ChatGPT to fix any errors I ran into. 

XX Overall, I had a lot of fun making this project and I learned a lot about statistics and data science.
