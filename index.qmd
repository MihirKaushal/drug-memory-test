<!-- Intro paragraph  -->

The effects of drugs on memory is very important to know for pharmaceutical companies that produce the medicine. The data is from an experiment on the effects of anti-anxiety medicine on memory recall. I used the data to find the causal effect of type of drug given to the participant and their difference in memory test score. I modeled the difference in memory test score before the drug minus after taking the drug for a set amount of time as a linear function of type of drug and dose amount. By analyzing the data, I was able to find the causal relationship between type of drug and difference in memory test score.
